     <h1>Configuration </h1>
     <h3>When you download the zip file, go to scriptcc.js once extracted. (I suggest you extract the files into a folder, since the icons are not in a folder.) When you go to scriptcc.js, you will see a configuration for the city to be set. You can set the city to a city (as usual), a zipcode, or geocode. (The comma must be close when inserting the longitude. Example: 33.85,-83.68)</h3>
